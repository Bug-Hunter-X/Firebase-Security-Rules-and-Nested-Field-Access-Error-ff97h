The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon Firebase error related to security rules and data structure.  It attempts to access a nested field within a document that doesn't exist, causing an error that's not always immediately obvious. 
```javascript
//Insecure Firebase Realtime Database rule:
'.read': true,
'.write': true,

//Attempting to read a non-existent nested field
db.ref('users/' + userId + '/profile/address/street').once('value', function(snapshot) {
  var street = snapshot.val();
  console.log(street);
});
```
